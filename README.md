<h1>CS120 - Web Programming & Engineering Class Folder</h1>

<h2>What is this purpose of this Git repository?</h2>


  This Git repository holds the classwork for my web programming & engineering class. I have made this repository public to demonstrate some of the skills I have learned during this class. 
  
  
<h2>What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?</h2>

  Notuber and its server immense-woodland was my favorite assignment. In summary, the requirement for the assignment was to create a ride-sharing app (Notuber) that displays vehicles from a seperate server (immense-woodland). I particularly enjoyed this assignement as it was the most 'real-life' assignment we had; specifcations were deliberately vague 
and I was exposed to frameworks and services that are commonly used in industry (heroku, Node.js). In the future, I intend to extend the functionalities of this skeleton ride-sharing app into something that looks less like a homework assignement and more like a functioning real-life ride-sharing app. 

<h2>What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Â </h2>

As a computer science student, one of my biggest gaps in knowledge was how to actually put a program on the internet. Sure I learned plenty about data structures and algorithms but it wasn't until I had finished this class that I actually understood how to get something from a local machine onto the internet. 

<h2> Acknowledgements </h2>
I would like to thank my professor Ming Chow for his mentorship, without which this repository would not exist.
