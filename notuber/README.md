1. All specifications have been implemented correctly.
2. I consulted the google developers tutorials for assistance on creating the initial map and then adding custom markers.
3. I spent about 2 hours. 

Load time without optimization:   0.54 (cached)  979.73 KB / 0.66 (non-cache) 2,675.11 KB  
Load time with optimzation:   0.41s, (cached)  979.16 KB / 0.52s (non-cache) 2,674.54 KB

With optimizations, page load time decreases significantly but file size only decreased by at most 1kb. Presumably, the filesize of the non-optimized files is not large enough for minification to make a significant difference in file size.
