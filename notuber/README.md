<h1> notuber </h1>

notuber is a basic interface for a ridesharing app. It displays avilable vehicles on the map, calculates the user's location and draws a polyline to the user's closest vehicle. The vehicles are retrieved from a server (https://immense-woodland-80683.herokuapp.com/rides). Based on the content of the server, the vehicles displayed will change.
