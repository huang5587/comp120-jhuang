<h1> notuber </h1>

notuber is a basic interface for a ridesharing app. It displays avilable vehicles on the map, calculates the user's location and draws a polyline to the user's closest vehicle. The vehicles are retrieved from a server (https://immense-woodland-80683.herokuapp.com/rides). Based on the content of the server, the vehicles displayed will change. 

<h2> Motivation </h2>
notuber was created as part of a homework assignment for a web programming class. In particular, notuber was made to demonstrate understanding of HTTP requests and using API libraries (specifically the google maps API). 

<h2> Installation </h2>
If you download these files you should be able to open index.html on your local server / web browser. As long as the heroku web server (see https://github.com/huang5587/comp120-jhuang/tree/master/immense-woodland-80683) then available cars should display on the map.
