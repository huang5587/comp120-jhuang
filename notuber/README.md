<h1> notuber </h1>
<h2> Features </h2>
notuber is a basic interface for a ridesharing app. It displays avilable vehicles on the map, calculates the user's location and draws a polyline to the user's closest vehicle. The vehicles are retrieved from a server (https://github.com/huang5587/comp120-jhuang/tree/master/immense-woodland-80683). Based on the content of the server, the vehicles displayed will change. Clicking on the location marker will display an info window which gives information about the client's closest available vehicle. 

<h2> Motivation </h2>
notuber was created as part of a homework assignment for a web programming class. In particular, notuber was made to demonstrate understanding of javascript, HTTP requests and using API libraries (specifically the google maps API). 

<h2> Installation </h2>
If you download these files you should be able to open index.html on your local server / web browser. As long as the heroku web server is functioning then available cars should display on the map.
